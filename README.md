# Network-Path-Tracer-CSE-360

My Introduction to Software Engineering (CSE 360) course in Fall 2018 had a group project component. The project was completed in two phases and managed using version control via Bitbucket and SourceTree. All development was done in Eclipse and code written in Java.

Phase 1 of the project required a Java-based GUI (Graphical User Interface) capable of inputting multiple occurences of an activity name, dependencies and duration for a node, then computing all possible paths for the resulting network diagram. The program would have to perform error-checking to detect incomplete paths, incorrect inputs, and network cycles. 

Phase 2 of the project had to have the same features as Phase 1, in addition to allowing the user to change the duration for an activity and save all data into a text file. The program also had to display critical paths in the network. 

The team consisted of myself, Wesley Guerra, Kathryn Rawn, and Shubham Mehta (joined during Phase 2). 

I headlined GUI development and wrote most of the code for the program. Everyone in the team equally contributed to the source code for the project and took turns error checking, developing test cases, and contributing to the user's guides.
